# OFFENSIVE SECURITY & REVERSE ENGINEERING (OSRE) Course

This repository is for the Offensive Security and Reverse Engineering ~~Offensive Software Exploitation~~ Course I used to teaching at Champlain College and currently sharing it for free online (check the YouTube channel for the recordings). Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on [HTID Course](http://opensecuritytraining.info/HTID.html), but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publicly available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.

### OFFENSIVE SECURITY & REVERSE ENGINEERING (FULL COURSE / 2021)
This is the whole course that was covered at Champlain College during Spring 20/21, yes during the COVID-19 pandemic! Unfortunately I was not able to cover all the modules due to time limitation, but other than that I had a great semester with my students and enjoyed teaching this course to them. Big thank you to each one of them, who all graduated now. The course could be found here [OSRE](https://github.com/ashemery/exploitation-course/tree/master/course/2021). The videos on my YouTube channel walk through most of them.

### Vulnerable Software
The vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/). I also used Stephen Bradshaw's [VulnServer](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver), plus maybe some other simple code that I prepared. Please check each lab for the software used in that specific lab and from where to download it.
