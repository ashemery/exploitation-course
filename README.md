# Offensive Software Exploitation (OSE) Course

This repository is for the Offensive Software Exploitation Course I am teaching at Champlain College and currently doing it for free online (check the YouTube channel for the recordings). Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on [HTID Course](http://opensecuritytraining.info/HTID.html), but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publicly available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.

### OFFENSIVE SECURITY & REVERSE ENGINEERING (FULL COURSE)
This is the whole course that was covered at Champlain College during Spring 20/21, yes during the COVID-19 pandemic! Unfortunately I was not able to cover all the modules due to time limitation, but other than that I had a great semester with my students and enjoyed teaching this course to them. Big thank you to each one of them, who all graduated now. The course could be found here [OSRE](https://github.com/ashemery/exploitation-course/tree/master/course/2021). The videos on my YouTube channel walk through most of them.

### Vulnerable Software
The vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/). I also used Stephen Bradshaw's [VulnServer](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver), plus maybe some other simple code that I prepared. Please check each lab for the software used in that specific lab and from where to download it.

This will be used for most of the labs, except for the EggHunter lab, I used a Windows 7 VM, also from Microsoft VMs (currently offline so check archive.org).
- All the targeted software is Intel/AMD 32-bit unless otherwise instructed.
